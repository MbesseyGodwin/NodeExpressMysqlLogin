## Technologies Used

Node.js
Express.js
Sequelize (ORM for interacting with the database)
MySQL (or any other supported database)
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
Bcrypt.js for password hashing
Cookie-session for managing user sessions
CORS for enabling Cross-OriginResource Sharing
Other npm packages as required

## Getting Started

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory and run npm install to install all dependencies.

## Configuration

Configure the database settings in the config/db.config.js file.
Update the secret key for JWT token signing in the config/auth.config.js file.
Ensure that the necessary environment variables are set, such as database credentials.

## Running the Server

Start the server by running npm start or node server.js in the terminal.
The server will start running on the specified port (default is 5000).

## Folder Structure

app: Contains application-specific files including routes, controllers, models, and middleware.
config: Configuration files for database connection and authentication.
models: Sequelize model definitions for database tables.
routes: Express route definitions for handling API requests.
middleware: Middleware functions for authentication and request validation.

## API Endpoints

POST /api/auth/signup: Create a new user account.
POST /api/auth/signin: Authenticate an existing user.
POST /api/auth/signout: Logout the current user.
GET /api/test/all: Get public content.
GET /api/test/user: Get user-specific content.
GET /api/test/mod: Get content for users with moderator role.
GET /api/test/admin: Get content for users with admin role.
For detailed information on each endpoint, refer to the inline comments in the server.js file.

## Database

The application uses Sequelize ORM to interact with the database. It supports various relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc. Ensure that the database is properly configured and accessible before running the server.

## Authentication and Authorization

User authentication is performed using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Passwords are hashed using bcrypt.js before storing them in the database.
Middleware functions are used for verifying JWT tokens and checking user roles.

## Error Handling

The application handles errors gracefully and provides meaningful error messages in the response. Error handling middleware is used to centralize error handling logic and improve code readability.
